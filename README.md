### Linter-YAML-Linting

`Linter-YAML-Linting` aims to provide functional and robust `YAML` linting functionality within Atom.

### Installation
The `Linter` Atom package is required and the `yamllint` executable.

### Usage
- This linter must be used on YAML files.
- To quickly and easily access issues in other files, you will need to change the settings inside `Linter-UI-Default`. For `Panel Represents` and/or `Statusbar Represents`, you will need to change their options to `Entire Project`. This will allow you to use either display to quickly access issues in other files by clicking on the displayed information.
